## Description

A site used to create connections with other geeks who enjoy Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and Harry Potter. The profile setup allows the user to choose their faction of interest within each of the sci-fi worlds. Depending on users interest, it will provide connections to message boards that match with their badges. After all, no one of House Lannister would ever get along with someone of House Starkâ€¦ the North Remembers.
